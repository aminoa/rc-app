## Please link to a program you've written from scratch

Here is a framework-free* python script that provides a workout analysis based on the exercises I have logged within Hevy (a workout app). It's attached here: https://github.com/aminoa/weighty/blob/master/weighty.py.

* It's hard to distinguish a framework and a library.

## What's the most fascinating thing you've learned this month?

I'm about 2/3 through Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment by Jason Schreier. Blizzard, now owned by Microsoft, is a gaming company that produced World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Starcraft, etc. I haven't played a Blizzard game (yet) but I enjoy reading game development stories! The book starts from the early days of Allen Adham and Mike Morhaime starting Blizzard to turning the company into a conglomerate with multiple hits and later to Bobby Kotick merging Activision and taking over as CEO of the joint company. While the corporate shenanigans were interesting, there was one overlooked but very impactful detail. 

Blizzard missed their chance to turn Battle.net into the de-facto platform for PC gaming! In 1996, programmer Mike O'Brien developed Battle.net as free online infrastructure for Diablo. Engineer Pat Wyatt wanted to turn Battle.net into a digital storefront, but Adham, Morhaime, and other executives wanted to focus on Blizzard products - Morhaime viewed the Blizzard brand as sacred and worked to ensure that each game would have the time it'd need to be successful. This brand protection however closed the board off to expanding their new platform. This is crazy in retrospect - Valve launched Steam 6 years later to provide easier content distribution/anti-piracy for games like Half Life 2 before opening up their storefront to conquer the space and in the years after, tech giants like Apple fought to keep users on their platform.

## What do you want to be doing in two years?

My deeper values haven't changed since my last app, but the time in-between has changed my application of those values. Specifically, I'm more strongly valuing the impact of my work over the technical challenge - with that being said, there's still a breadth to the type of work I see myself doing. 

Starting with values:

- Mission-driven work: I want to have a positive impact on others and the communities I'm a part of and organizations/companies that envelope my ideals include digital rights groups such as the EFF or Internet Archive and educational companies like Coursera or Khan Academy.

- Solving challenging problems within a smart team: My Algorithmic ML class encompassed this (deep-diving into the material, working collaboratively on open-ended problem sets, and constructing creative proofs)

In terms of the potential paths:

- A masters/PhD program that focuses on low-level hardware optimization for ML models or exploring the theory side of ML (like sketching algorithms or optimization) and applying my research at open source ML companies like Mistral

- Working with the Software Preservation Network and Video Game History Foundation to lobby for legislation to protect/provide exemptions for emulators - I've been motivated by Nintendo's recent takedown of emulators and the Copyright Office refusing to budge on opening up game access for researchers

- Working at Duolingo or Khan Academy to develop secure LLM chatbots to help students study their material

## Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

Since I wrote my previous application, I worked on several projects.

- Implemented the CPU on my rust re-implementation of my Game Boy emulator 
- Got my Time Tracking PR into Dolphin (https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/03/10/dolphin-progress-report-release-2503/#2412-305-track-time-played-core-and-qt-by-aminoa).
- Worked through 4 chapters of Nand2Tetris
- Developed Ski, a CSAW 2024 iOS reverse engineering challenge (recruit.aneeshmaganti.com/challenges)

While this period grew me as a programmer, it kept me acutely aware that the collaborative environment is crucial for doing more challenging and innovative work â€” coming up with new ideas is challenging without being in a diverse environment of motivated people to feel inspired. In my previous app, I highlighted that my experience founding BUGS, the open source club, to bring people to work on open source projects and time hanging out in the OSRIS lab to be in a group of motivated students drew me to apply to RC to be humbled. This time, I'd say that my chance to focus on meaningful personal projects highlighted the value that a motivated community provides - a place to learn from others, develop new CS interests that diverge from what I've previously done, and share my knowledge.

## What would you like to work on at RC?

I'm prioritizing the projects compared to my previous app and also I want to focus more on hanging out and talking with others to learn about their own interests/projects to make the most of my time (and have more fun!). With that being said, here's a couple of ideas:

Develop baseband emulation for researching a low-level iPhone 2G emulator
- Emulation is important for software interoperability and preservation (and current iPhone emulation isn't good)
- Based on de Vos' iPod Touch emulation work, I'll research the baseband (cellular) component and write and incorporate a C++ reimplementation

Learn graphics fundamentals with Vulkan
- I have very little experience with graphics but it's an area I always wanted to explore as rendering always seemed cool 
- Follow https://vkguide.dev/ and write a toy game engine

Feature.gb - A Game Boy adaptation of the Feature story
- I'm working on the story of Feature, the BUGS mascot, on her journey through FOSS after finishing my research (https://stalereference.com/posts/open-source/)
- Use GB Studio or GBSDK to develop a 2D platformer adaptation of the story

Contribute to Dolphin Emulator an "FPS" matrix interpolation mode (allows doubling framerates in GameCube/Wii games)
- Using Dolphin's fast forward and monitoring the draw calls, interpolate all vertices between the current and next frame to create a buffer frame

## Do you plan to attend RC in-person, remotely, or some combination of the two? How will this affect your working style?

I plan on attending in-person (which I find is much more collaborative than online). 

# Background

## Describe your programming background in a few sentences.

I initially got into programming by making games in Scratch and doing some online JavaScript courses back in 8th grade and continued with some classes in high school. I got more into it while studying CS at NYU and doing research (in theoretical ML and later hardware). My personal projects have tended towards systems programming (C++) and web development (Next.js apps).

## Have you worked professionally as a programmer?

I'll be joining Affirm full-time quite a bit after the RC batch ends. I interned at Qualcomm last summer as a SWE intern within the AI/ML organization. I worked for some smaller startups before that. 

## Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

I have completed my BS in CS at NYU on September 22nd, 2024.

## What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?

I will have few commitments during this batch and they shouldn't interfere during the core hours at Recurse Center.

## How did you first hear about RC?

I originally mentioned it to a friend (Sachin Iyer) about a year ago and to a couple more friends in the months between but I'm not sure where I heard about it beforehand.

## How long ago did you first hear about RC?

2 years ago

## What convinced you to apply today?
