## Please link to a program you've written from scratch

I looked through most of my projects and I realized it's been a while since I've written a totally framework-free program (also distinguishing betweena a library and framework is hard). Regardless, I wrote a Python script that provides a workout analysis based on the exercises I have logged within Hevy (a workout app). It's attached here: https://github.com/aminoa/weighty/blob/master/weighty.py.

## What's the most fascinating thing you've learned this month?

Learning about emulation law has been quite fascinating. I've written a couple of simple emulators in the last couple of years and have played with them for even more, but more recently, after Nintendo took down Ryujinx (a Switch emulator) last month, I felt compelled to research more into the legal side and write a blog post.

To refresh, emulation is hardware simulation done via software. Copyright protects creative works, not functional ideas. For example, the concept of a toothbrush is functional but an Aneesh-branded toothbrush (with an in-vogue design) is copyrightable. Similarly, the system of the PlayStation is functional, whereas Sony's product is creative. Sony sued multiple emulator developers on potentially related copyright infringement but, twice in a row, the courts ruled in favor of the developers.

However, the DMCA complicates this: circumvention of technological protection measures (encryption) is now illegal but there is an exemption to permit reverse engineering to create an interoperable program; there are very . Earlier this year, Nintendo sued Yuzu (another Switch emulator) and argued that it broke the DMCA by breaking game encryption (though Yuzu soon settled). It's unclear how a court would rule in a future hypothetical lawsuit between Nintendo/(insert game/tech company) and an emulation team, but I certainly hope the courts would use current precedent to guide their decision.

## What do you want to be doing in two years?

Rather than try to predict my future career/project interests (probably the combination of ML/embedded systems), here are a couple deeper goals I have.

Work at a company/organization that has a mission statement I feel passionate about:
- I want to have a positive impact on others and communities I'm a part of; I would look to (but not limited to) places such as the Raspberry Pi Foundation (making computers accessible), the Internet Archive (preserving the web), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (protecting our digital rights/privacy) or Khan Academy (free online learning platform) as examples.

Solving technically challenging and interesting problems within a smart team
- To explain, at NYU, the most memorable class I took was Algorithmic Machine Learning - I worked in a study group on the problem sets and it was intellectually stimulating (and a little tiring) to develop proofs for the problems our professor gave us. I felt energized because the answer was not obvious but working through the problems with the other masters/PhD pushed me to be creative in my thinking and develop a deep understanding of the material. I want to work in an environment that gives me this feeling again.

## Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

I've enjoyed working on projects on my own, but I always found myself yearning to 1) bring others to work on collaborative projects and 2) bring myself to environments where I could push myself on these projects. 

For 1) I started BUGS (https://bugsnyu.com), the open source club at NYU, to bring people together to work on cool open source projects (the BUGS website, the NYU CS Wiki, and NYU Syllabi are three examples); the club evolved into helping teach the NYU CS community through workshops and speaker events.

For 2), I always pushed myself to be in collaborative academic environments. I spent a large amount of time at the OSIRIS lab, NYU's cybersecurity lab in Brooklyn, to be with other motivated CS/cyber students. The environment was conducive to learn from my peers (CTFs, containerization knowledge, reverse engineering, etc), stay motivated to work on projects, and push myself to learn/create cooler things (I wrote 2 CTF challenges for NYU CSAW).

I find that the Recurse Center provides the same type of dedicated environment that would push me while having a project focus from BUGS. I would like to see new faces, ideas, and concepts to make me feel inspired and jealous! It humbles me but also boosts my excitement about what I work on, what others work on, and the field as a whole.

## What would you like to work on at RC?

It's hard to exactly know which direction I would go in Recurse Center, especially since I believe in the idea of catching the waves (ideas) when they come by rather than forcing myself to follow a checklist. With that being said, that doesn't mean I don't have a checklist of stuff that I would like to work on!

- Develop baseband emulation as part of researching a low-level iPhone 2G emulator
  - The iPhone is the most important computing device of the 21st century so I find it extremely perplexing that there isn't an open source emulator for the platform
    - Emulation is the best method to preserve hardware in order to the original apps and games for the platform
    - I briefly looked into existing solutions as part of an independent study under Professor BDG but I would want to focus on the baseband (cellular) component of the original iPhone 
- Rewrite my Game Boy emulator in Rust ðŸ¦€
  - I wrote dot-matrix (https://github.com/aminoa/dot-matrix) last summer but a) I didn't finish the graphics/control side and b) I dare myself to attempt APU (audio) emulation. I also wanted to use this opportunity to improve my Rust skills.
- Write a Git re-implementation following this guide: https://wyag.thb.lt/.
- A C compiler I feel sad I didn't take a compiler class at NYU. -->
- Write "Feature", a story about a caterpillar named Feature (https://bugsnyu.com/images/logo/feature.png) who, along with Tux the Penguin, goes on a journey to spread FOSS values 
  - Even though I graduated, I feel it's important to embody the BUGS' values in an accessible and engaging text. I researched several texts discussing the FOSS movement (I would highly recommend Tozzi's book "For Fun and Profit" on the subject). 
  - Getting feedback from those in the RC could help me improve the story/improve its authenticity and also be a lot of fun!

## Do you plan to attend RC in-person, remotely, or some combination of the two? How will this affect your working style?

I plan on attending primarily in-person (which I find is much more collaborative than online).

# Background

## Describe your programming background in a few sentences.

I initially got into programming by making games in Scratch and doing some online JavaScript courses back in 8th grade and continued with some classes in high school. I got more into it while studying CS at NYU and doing research (in theoretical ML and later hardware). My personal projects have tended towards systems programming (C++) and web development (Next.js apps).

## Have you worked professionally as a programmer?

I interned at Qualcomm over the summer as a SWE intern within the AI/ML organization. I worked for some smaller startups before that.

## Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

I have completed my BS in CS at NYU on September 22nd, 2024.

## What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?

I will have few commitments during this batch and they shouldn't interfere during the core hours at Recurse Center.

## How did you first hear about RC?

Good question! I (think?) I first heard about the program when I was rebuilding the NYU CS Wiki (https://nyucswiki.com) around 1.5 years ago. I looked at the old NYU CS Wiki website from the previous iteration of the club and found the link on the website; I thought it sounded really cool but I didn't have the time to commit. I kept it in mind though and even told some friends who I thought would enjoy this.

## How long ago did you first hear about RC?

1.5 years ago.

## What convinced you to apply today?
