## Please link to a program you've written from scratch

I looked through most of my projects and I realized it's been a while since I've written a totally framework-free program (also distinguishing between a library and framework is hard). Regardless, I wrote a Python script that provides a workout analysis based on the exercises I have logged within Hevy (a workout app). It's attached here: https://github.com/aminoa/weighty/blob/master/weighty.py.

## What's the most fascinating thing you've learned this month?

Learning about emulation law has been quite fascinating. I've written a couple of simple emulators in the last couple of years and have played with them for even longer, but more recently, after Nintendo took down Ryujinx (a Switch emulator) last month, I felt compelled to research more into the legal side and write a blog post (https://stalereference.com/posts/switch-emulation/).

To refresh, emulation is hardware simulation done via software. Copyright protects creative works, not functional ideas. For example, the concept of a toothbrush is functional but an Aneesh-branded toothbrush (with an in-vogue design) is copyrightable. Similarly, the PlayStation architecture is functional, whereas Sony's product is creative. Sony sued multiple emulator developers on potentially related copyright infringement but the courts ruled in favor of the developers twice.

However, the DMCA complicates this: circumvention of technological protection measures (encryption) is now illegal but there is a (mostly untested) exemption to permit reverse engineering to create an interoperable program. Earlier this year, Nintendo sued Yuzu (another Switch emulator) and argued that it broke the DMCA by breaking game encryption (Yuzu soon settled). It's unclear how a court would rule in a future hypothetical lawsuit between Nintendo/(insert game/tech company) and an emulation team, I hope they rely on the intention of the copyright rulings to foster competition and aid in preservation.

## What do you want to be doing in two years?

[//]: I'll probably give you the same comment that you gave me. Although you pull specific examples of places that emulate the ideals that you have, I think that it would be easier to understand if you gave some examples of what you could be doing specifically in two years.
[//]: I also think that giving some concrete examples makes the points hit much harder than they do in isolation
[//]: I'm part of; -> I'm part of.
[//]: To explain, at NYU -> At NYU,


Rather than try to predict my future career/project interests (probably the combination of ML/embedded systems), here are a couple deeper goals I have.

Work at a company/organization that has a mission statement I feel passionate about:
- I want to have a positive impact on others and communities I'm a part of; I would look to (but not limited to) places such as the Raspberry Pi Foundation (making computers accessible), the Internet Archive (preserving the web), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (protecting our digital rights/privacy) or Khan Academy (free online learning platform) as examples.

Solving technically challenging and interesting problems within a smart team
- At NYU, the most memorable class I took was Algorithmic Machine Learning - I worked in a study group on the problem sets and it was intellectually stimulating (and a little tiring) to develop proofs for the problems our professor gave us. I felt energized because the answer was not obvious but working through the problems with the other masters/PhD pushed me to be creative in my thinking and develop a deep understanding of the material. I want to work in an environment that gives me this feeling again.

## Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

I've enjoyed working on projects on my own, but I always found myself yearning to 1) bring others to work on collaborative projects and 2) bring myself to environments where I could push myself on these projects. 

For 1) I started BUGS (https://bugsnyu.com), the open source club at NYU, to bring people together to work on cool open source projects (the BUGS website, the NYU CS Wiki, and NYU Syllabi are three examples); the club evolved into helping teach the NYU CS community through workshops and speaker events.

For 2), I always pushed myself to be in collaborative academic environments. I spent a large amount of time at the OSIRIS lab, NYU's cybersecurity lab in Brooklyn, to be with other motivated CS/cyber students. The environment was conducive to learn from my peers (CTFs, containerization knowledge, reverse engineering, etc), stay motivated to work on projects, and push myself to learn/create cooler things (I wrote 2 CTF challenges for NYU CSAW).

I find that the Recurse Center provides the same type of dedicated environment that would push me while having a project focus from BUGS. I would like to see new faces, ideas, and concepts to make me feel inspired and jealous! It humbles me but also boosts my excitement about what I work on, what others work on, and the field as a whole.

## What would you like to work on at RC?

It's hard to exactly know which direction I would go in Recurse Center, especially since I believe in the idea of catching the waves (ideas) when they come by. With that being said, that doesn't mean I don't have a checklist!

Develop baseband emulation as part of researching a low-level iPhone 2G emulator
- Emulation is necessary for software preservation so I want to tackle this, though this is grand project
- Based on existing iPod Touch emulation work by Martijn de Vos, I'll focus on researching the baseband (cellular) component such that I can write and incorporate a C++ re-implementation

De-QEMUize existing iPod touch emulator
- Related to the above item, I want to see if I can insert an existing ARM dynamic recompiler to improve performance
- This would also require a significant rewrite of the iPod Touch emulator

Rewrite my Game Boy emulator (in Rust ðŸ¦€)
- I wrote dot-matrix last summer but a) I didn't finish the graphics and b) I dare myself to attempt APU (audio) emulation. 
- I also wanted to use this opportunity to improve my Rust skills.

Write a Git re-implementation 
- Following the "Write Yourself a Git" guide (also using Rust)

Contribute to Dolphin Emulator an "FPS" matrix interpolation mode (allows doubling framerates in GameCube/Wii games)
- Using Dolphin's fast forward and monitoring the draw calls, interpolate all vertices between current and next frame to create a buffer frame

## Do you plan to attend RC in-person, remotely, or some combination of the two? How will this affect your working style?

I plan on attending primarily in-person (which I find is much more collaborative than online).

# Background

## Describe your programming background in a few sentences.

I initially got into programming by making games in Scratch and doing some online JavaScript courses back in 8th grade and continued with some classes in high school. I got more into it while studying CS at NYU and doing research (in theoretical ML and later hardware). My personal projects have tended towards systems programming (C++) and web development (Next.js apps).

## Have you worked professionally as a programmer?

I interned at Qualcomm over the summer as a SWE intern within the AI/ML organization. I worked for some smaller startups before that.

## Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

I have completed my BS in CS at NYU on September 22nd, 2024.

## What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?

I will have few commitments during this batch and they shouldn't interfere during the core hours at Recurse Center.

## How did you first hear about RC?

Good question! I (think?) I first heard about the program when I was rebuilding the NYU CS Wiki (https://nyucswiki.com) around 1.5 years ago. I looked at the old NYU CS Wiki website from the previous iteration of the club and found the link on the website; I thought it sounded really cool but I didn't have the time to commit. I kept it in mind though and even told some friends who I thought would enjoy this.

## How long ago did you first hear about RC?

1.5 years ago.

## What convinced you to apply today?
