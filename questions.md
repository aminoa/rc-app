## Please link to a program you've written from scratch

I looked through most of my projects and I realized it's been a while since I've written a totally framework-free program (also distinguishing betweena a library and framework is hard). Regardless, I wrote a Python script that provides a workout analysis based on the exercises I have logged within Hevy (a workout app). It's attached here: https://github.com/aminoa/weighty/blob/master/weighty.py.

## What's the most fascinating thing you've learned this month?

I would say learning about emulation law has been quite fascinating (especially how copyright law, fair use, the DMCA, and its reverse engineering exemption come into play). I've writtten simple emulation software for a couple years now and have played with them for even more, but more recently, especially after Nintendo took down Ryujinx, a Switch emulator, I felt compelled to research more into the legal side. I'm also attracted to having a well-rounded holistic understanding of things I spend a lot of time in.

There is a lot to say on the topic but I'll be brief. To refresh ourselves, emulation is hardware simulation done via software. Copyright law generally protects creative works, not functional ideas. So for example, the concept of a toothbrush is functional. However, the Aneesh-branded toothbrush (with a very in vogue design) is copyrightable. Similarily, the concept/system of the PlayStation 1 is functional, whereas Sony's product is creative. Even when Sony sued on potentially related copyright infringment, the courts ruled in favor of Connectix that it was fair use for the developers to copy the BIOS for the purpose of reverse engineering, or getting access to the functional elements.

- In 1998, the DMCA was passed and added a couple more wrinkles to this. 

- Copyright law has been ok with protecting emulation 
- The DMCA prevents circumvention of technological protection measures (basically encryption)

- Learning how copyright precedent applies different to emulation than the DMCA. 
- I've done a lot of research into emulation legality after the Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx was taken down.

Since I finished writing my post, the Copyright Office gave its rulings on a related issue, preventing offsite library access to video games for research. This is an area I do want to continue to explore. If you would like to learn more, feel free to read my blog post attached here (https://stalereference.com/posts/switch-emulation/) or see the reactions to it here (https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1g8yf9b/nintendo_is_killing_switch_emulation_via_murky/).

## What do you want to be doing in two years?

It's really hard to give a very definitive answer (I would have given quite a different answer 2 years ago) but I have some ideas.

- Emulation related definitely, whether that be working on more novel hardware is yet to be seen
- Working for an organization like the SPN so that video game researchers have access to older games for study 
- I've done some ML work while at NYU and I definitly enjoyed the more theoretical side of research - possibly getting back into that
- Ideally also something totally opposite to what I currently do. For example, for CSAW, I'm currently developing a Swift app to act as a reverse engineering challenge - I find it really cool to delve into new ares of CS that I'm less comfortable with. 


## Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

- I really enjoy coding with others, it makes me feel really happy
- I've worked on tons of personal projects throughout university but it's a different experience when you're not on your own.

- I also like the academic environment that school provides but I of course would rather work on personal projects than homework
- I started BUGS for a similar reason (the open source club at NYU), I also got to experince that type of environment at the OSIRIS lab at NYU (cybersecurity lab)
  - I felt a lot of the clubs at my school very career-driven. Not as far as "join this club and you'll get a job!" but that was a motivation for a lot of the members/attendees. I wanted something more collaborative and project focused.


- On my own, my ideaset is limited to, well, me. My ideas are going to naturally branch off of what I currently know about. But I like seeing new faces, new ideas, to make me feel inspired. I want to feel jealous! It's a really cool thing to be humbled and then dive into a totally new thing. In some ways, it lowers my self-confidence but also boosts my excitement about the field a lot more. 

## What would you like to work on at RC?

It's hard to exactly know which direction I would go in Recurse Center, especially since I believe in the idea of catching the waves (ideas) when they come by rather than forcing myself to follow a checklist. With that being said, that doesn't mean I don't have a checklist of stuff that I would like to work on.

- Developing open source low-level iPhone 2G emulation
  - I briefly worked on this as a research project under Professor Brendan Dolan Gavitt but I wasn't able to commit as much as I wanted; the iPhone is the most important computing device of the 21st century so being able to access these apps and games in an preserved and accessible manner is important.
  - I expect this project to be what I focus on
  - (There is touchHLE but I'm looking to make something more lower level, something in line with Martijn de Vos' research: https://devos50.github.io/blog/2022/ipod-touch-qemu/)
  - My dream is to create the 'Dolphin Emulator' for iPhone emulation - a highly performant, accurate and user-friendly emulation platform that allows users to relieve their memories with the original hardware.
- Rewrite my Game Boy emulator in Rust ðŸ¦€
  - I wrote dot-matrix (https://github.com/aminoa/dot-matrix) last summer but a) I didn't finish the graphics/control side and b) I dare myself to attempt APU emulation. I also wanted to use this opportunity to improve my Rust skills.
- Write a Git reimplementation (following this guide: https://wyag.thb.lt/).
  - I like to 'de-abstract' tools and while most of the time I don't bother since I would rather spend my time on someething novel, Git is just within the realm of simplicity where it would cool to do to get a better understanding of how it works under the hood.
- Developing "Feature", a story about a caterpiller with Tux the Penguin who goes on a journey to discover open source
  - Ok, this one probably caught you off guard. There is a mascot of BUGS named "Feature" (it's not a bug, it's a feature!): https://bugsnyu.com/images/logo/feature.png. While every organization should have some mission statement, I felt that it was important to embody some of the values that I found really important in an accessible and engaging text. To research this, I read a number of texts discussing the FOSS movement (I would highly recommend Tozzi's book "For Fun and Profit" on the subject). I think being able to develop the storyline and show it off for feedback would be really useful and fun.
  - While some of this I can certainly do on my own, getting feedback from a variety of Software Engineers would hepl a lot 
- A C compiler! 
  - I feel sad that I never got to learn this while at NYU despite me really wanting to. 

## Do you plan to attend RC in-person, remotely, or some combination of the two? How will this affect your working style?

I plan on attending mostly in-person which I find provides more of the benefits of being in a communal setting rather than remotely.

# Background

## Describe your programming background in a few sentences.

I initally got into programming from making games in Scratch and doing some online JavaScript courses back in 8th grade and continued with classes in high school. I got much more back into it while studying CS at NYU, even doing research (initally in theoretical ML and later in hardware). My personal projects have tended towrads systems programming (C++) and web development (Next.js apps).

## Have you worked professionally as a programmer?

I interned at Qualcomm over the summer as a SWE intern within the AI/ML organization. I worked for some smaller startups before that.

## Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

I have completed my bachelors in CS at NYU on September 2024.

## What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?

I will have few commitments during this batch and they shouldn't interfere during the core hours at Recurse Center.

## How did you first hear about RC?

Good question! I (think?) I first heard about the program when I was rebuilding the NYU CS Wiki (https://nyucswiki.com) around 1.5 years ago. I looked at the old NYU CS Wiki website from the previous iteration of the club and found the link on the website; I thought it sounded really cool but I didn't have the time to commit. I kept it in mind though and even told some friends who I thought would enjoy this.

## How long ago did you first hear about RC?

1.5 years ago.

## What convinced you to apply today?
